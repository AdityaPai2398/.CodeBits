### Solution:



### Strategy:

1- create a new array with lenght of the arr 

2- The new array value indices are 0 ---------> [0,0,0,0,0]

3- Loop throug the arry length range

4- if the number in the right index , it would add 1 , if not it will return 0 

[1,2,1,0,1]

5- Now if it is greater than 1 , it means repeated number

6- if it is equal to 0, means the number is missing
