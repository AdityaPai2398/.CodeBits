#### 1- What is Functional Language?
It is a approach that treats every computation as a mathematical function. The output of the function relies on what input was given for the function, and do not depend on series of steps that precede the function.

Functional programming relies heavily on __recursion__. The difference between recursion in functional programming and iteration in procedural programming is recursion repeat functions and not a series of steps

Examples : __Erlang, Haskell, Lisp, Scala__

#### 2-  What is Declarative Language?
Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, and not how you want to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how. Examples of declarative programming languages are __SQL,Prolog, and HTML__


####  3- What is Rule-based Languages?  ?  



#### 4)What is the difference between compilers and interpreters?




#### 5) What is a binary file ?

#### 6) What is procedural Language?
It is a language that tells the computer what to do step by step. It relies on procedures known as routines.

__A procedure__ consists of multiple series of computation. Procedural programming is also referred to as __imperative language__ or structured

A procedural programming is very intuitive, as it runs as the programmer expect.Example of procedural languages __Fortan, C__

A common technique in procedural programming is to use iteration, means that you write a set of steps, and you tell the computer to repeat for certain number of times

#### 7- What is Metaprogramming ?
 __Meta programming__  allows programs  to create method fast  
  instead of having to Identify them in the program itself.
  Metaprogramming reduced repetitive code
  
  
  #### 8) What is Object-oriented Language?
 
  #### 9) What is data structure language?
  
 #### 10 ) What is data flow?
